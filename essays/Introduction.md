Hello, I am a Junior at the Universtiy of Hawaii at Manoa, studying business. In my free time I enjoy spending the day at the beach catching barrels, freediving, reading, and goofing around with my friends. 
I live on Oahu for school but enjoy getting away and visiting my mom and grandpa on the Big Island. We live in Kona, in a unique place called the Kona Cloud Forest Sanctuary, where my mom enjoys hosting events such as yoga retreats as well as jungle tours around the property.
I'm orignally from Washington where I grew up playing sports such as Lacrosse, Football, Swim and Dive. I have two older brothers and a girlfriend. I love business and am excited to get my own up and running soon.
